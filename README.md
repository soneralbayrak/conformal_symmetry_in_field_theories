# Conformal Symmetry in Field Theories

These are the notes of the lectures prepared for the ``Advanced Topics in Theoretical Physics''  summer school at *Feza GÃ¼rsey Merkezi*, September 2021. These notes are mostly based on other discussions and I provided the sources  in relevant places. I may update the notes even after the summer school to keep it up-to-date and self-contained; there are also reminders *in blue* for me to add further discussion/comments.
